## ✨ Features

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: High-quality neural voices from Microsoft Azure with SSML payload support.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: High-accuracy real-time speech recognition for Home Assistant Voice Assistant (Assist).
- **Dynamic Voice Discovery**: Dynamically fetches 500+ Azure neural voices across all regions and languages.
- **UI Configuration & Options Flow**: Easy setup via UI with selectors for default voice, language, speaking style, style intensity, pitch, rate, audio formats (`mp3`/`wav`/`ogg`), and profanity filtering.
- **Diagnostic Entities**: Monitor API connection status and cached voice counts.
- **Custom Service Action**: `azure_speech.refresh_voices` service action to update cached voices on demand.
- **Pure Async Architecture**: Built with lightweight `aiohttp` (no native C binary dependencies, fully non-blocking on HA event loop).
